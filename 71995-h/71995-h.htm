<h3>
INTRODUCTION
</h3>

<p>
Although, as in duty bound, a member
of his county Archæological Society, no
claim to what may be dignified by antiquarian
research is made by the Author of this modest
publication.
</p>

<p>
If he is entitled to any credit at all, it can
be merely in respect of the fact that (in addition
to making the best use of the historical stores
and constant kindness of Mr. Hastings Worrin),
he has regarded it as a kind of minor act of local
patriotism to try to gather together and set
forth, in as simple and attractive a fashion as
possible, such data as, with a little trouble, may
be collected concerning a Custom all the
surviving records of which are of interest and
importance to those who live in Great or Little
Dunmow or their vicinity.
</p>

<p>
The subject has, however, a wider appeal.
It is so familiar that throughout the land there
can be few persons who have never heard of
the Dunmow Flitch.  It is so old as to be
enshrined, for as long as English Literature shall
endure, in Chaucer and Langland.
</p>

<p>
It is proper to mention, perhaps, that most
of the subjects illustrated have not before been
photographed for publication.
</p>

<p>
For corrections or for any light on difficulties
still confronting the historian of the Flitch, the
Author will be greatly obliged.
</p>

<p>
In order to save labour to other students of
the subject, he may perhaps mention that he has
searched the following MSS. at the British
Museum: "Registrum Cartarum Prioratus
de Dunmawe," "Exscripta è Chronico de
Dunmow," "Collectanea ex Chronico de
Dunmowe," "Excerpta ex Chronico de Parva
Dunmowe," "Memorandum de Pernis, a
Prioratu de Dunmowe," the household accounts
of the last Prior of Dunmow, and "Transcripta
ex Libro Rubeo in Scarrario," and has
glanced through certain Court Rolls.  One list
of presentations of the Bacon (which appears in
Leland) is described in the catalogue at the
British Museum as "perhaps a fragment of some
larger work on the subject."  Does it still exist?

<h3>
CHAPTER I
<br><br>
A Narrative of Nine Hundred Years
</h3>

<p>
Everybody knows that delightful Shakespearean
scene in which Sir John Falstaff
robs the travellers at Gadshill.  But some readers
of the play must have been puzzled a little by the
sorry Knight's ejaculation&mdash;
</p>

<p>
"On, bacons, on!"
</p>

<p>
From the Conquest, however, it had been common
to call the multitude hogs.  To this practice,
it has been declared, we owe the phrase "to save
one's bacon."  Is not bacon the back and sides of
the hog&mdash;the part, therefore, on which a blow
would generally fall?  And is not "to save one's
bacon," obviously, to escape a blow?
</p>

<p>
But it is possible that "to save one's bacon"
may have had, in part at any rate, another origin.
In "The Wife of Bath's Prologue" in the
<i>Canterbury Tales</i>, which were given to the world as long
ago as the fourteenth century, Chaucer's
free-spoken dame says&mdash;
</p>

<p class="poem">
  The bacon wae not fet for hem, I trow,<br>
  That som men have in Essex at Donmow.<br>
</p>

<p><br></p>

<p>
May not this conceivably be the Bacon of the
popular saying?
</p>

<p>
The curious Dunmow Custom, by which a
Flitch of Bacon has been given to married folk
who have sworn that, for a year and a day, they
have neither had differences nor wished
themselves unwed, is certainly very old.
</p>

<p>
It may, indeed, have come over with the Conqueror.
More than one book of antiquities avers
that "at the abbey of Saint Melaine near
Rennes"&mdash;the old capital of Brittany&mdash;there had
been hanging, for more than six centuries, a side
of Bacon "still quite fresh," which had been set
apart for the first pair who "for a year and a day
had lived without dispute and grumbling" and
without repenting of their marriage.
</p>

<p>
To the Dunmow Custom we have a reference
not only in old Chaucer, but in that great song of
England, The Vision of William concerning Piers
the Plowman, written under the shadow of the
Black Death.  Says the good Langland&mdash;
</p>

<p class="poem">
  Many a couple since the Pestilence<br>
  Have plighted them together;<br>
  The fruit that they bring forth<br>
  Is foul words<br>
  In jealousy without happiness,<br>
  And quarrelling in bed;<br>
  They have no children but strife,<br>
  And slapping between them,<br>
  And though they go to Dunmow<br>
  (Unless the Devil help!)<br>
  To follow after the Flitch<br>
  They never after obtain it;<br>
  And unless they both are perjured,<br>
  They lose the bacon.[*]<br>
</p>

<p class="footnote">
[*] The last four lines appear as follows in the "C-text"
of Professor Skeat's monumental two volume edition of
the poem&mdash;
</p>

<p class="footnote">
  Thauh thei don hem to Donemowe . bote the deuel hem helpe<br>
  To folwen for the flicche . feccheth thei hit neuere;<br>
  Bote thei bothe be for-swore . that bacon thei tyne.<br>
</p>

<p><br></p>

<p>
Then in <i>Reliquiae Antiquae</i>, which dates
back to the fifteenth century, another poet,
discoursing in relation to the Seventh
Commandment, laments that he can
</p>

<p class="poem">
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;fynd no man that will enquere<br>
  The parfyte wais unto Dunmow;<br>
  For they repent them within a year,<br>
  And many within a week and souner men trow.<br>
</p>

<p><br></p>

<p>
Yet another century later one Howell says
choicely&mdash;
</p>

<p class="poem">
  Do not fetch your wife from Dunmow<br>
  For so you may bring home two sides of a sow!<br>
</p>

<p><br></p>

<p>
In fact, up and down our literature there are
plenty of references to the Dunmow Flitch.
</p>

<p><br><br><br></p>

<h3>
CHAPTER II
<br><br>
The Priory and the Rhymester
</h3>

<p>
The gravest historians have given accounts of
the beginnings of the Dunmow Custom.
There is Dugdale, for instance, who was born
in 1686.  He writes in his <i>Monasticon</i>&mdash;
</p>

<p><br></p>

<p class="quote">
Robert Fitzwalter, who lived long beloved by King
Henry, the son of King John (as also of all the realm),
betook himself in his latter days to prayer and deeds of
charity, and great and bountiful alms to the poor, kept
great hospitality, and re-edified the decayed Priory of
Dunmow, which Juga, a most devout and religious woman,
had builded; in which Priory arose a custom, began and
instituted either by him or some of his ancestors, which is
verified by the common saying or proverb, "that he which
repents him not of his marriage, either sleeping or waking,
in a year and a day, may lawfully go to Dunmow and fetch
a Gammon of Bacon."  It is certain that such a custom
there was, and that the Bacon was delivered with such
solemnity and triumph as they of the Priory and Town
could make&mdash;continuing till the dissolution of that house.
The party or pilgrim took the Oath before the Prior of the
Convent, and the Oath was administered with long process
and much solemn singing and chanting.
</p>

<p><br></p>

<p>
But how did the Custom actually come about?
Harrison Ainsworth has explained convincingly
in his rhyme, <i>The Custom of Dunmow</i>&mdash;
</p>

<p class="poem">
  "What seek you here, my children dear?<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Why kneel ye down thus lowly<br>
  Upon the stones, beneath the porch<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of this our Convent holy?"<br>
  The Prior old the pair bespoke<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In faltering speech, and slowly.<br>
</p>

<p class="poem">
  Their modest garb would seem proclaim<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The pair of low degree,<br>
  But though in cloth of frieze arrayed,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A stately youth was he;<br>
  While she, who knelt down by his side,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Was beautiful to see.<br>
</p>

<p class="poem">
  "A Twelvemonth and a Day have fled<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Since first we were united;<br>
  And from that hour," the young man said,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"No change our hopes has blighted.<br>
  Fond faith with fonder faith we've paid.<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And love with love requited.<br>
</p>

<p class="poem">
  "True to each other have we been;<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;No dearer object seeing,<br>
  Than each has in the other found;<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In everything agreeing.<br>
  And every look, and word, and deed<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That breed dissension fleeing.<br>
</p>

<p class="poem">
  "All this we swear, and take in proof<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Our Lady of Dunmow!*<br>
  For She, who sits with saints above,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Well knows that it is so.<br>
  Attest our Vow, thou reverend man,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And bless us ere we go!"<br>
</p>

<p class="footnote">
* The accent in Dunmow is on the first syllable, not
as placed by Ainsworth and other rhymers.
</p>

<p class="poem">
  The Prior old stretch'd forth his hands;<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Heaven prosper ye!" quoth he;<br>
  "O'er such as ye, right gladly we<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Say '<i>Benedicite!</i>'"<br>
  On this, the kneeling pair uprose&mdash;<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Uprose full joyfully.<br>
</p>

<p class="poem">
  Just then, pass'd by the Convent cook&mdash;<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And moved the young man's glee;<br>
  On his broad back a mighty Flitch<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of Bacon brown bore he.<br>
  So heavy was the load, I wis,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It scarce mote carried be.<br>
</p>

<p class="poem">
  "Take ye that Flitch," the Prior cried,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Take it, fond pair, and go;<br>
  Fidelity, like yours, deserves<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The boon I now bestow.<br>
  Go, feast your friends, and think upon<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Convent of Dunmow."<br>
</p>

<p class="poem">
  "Good Prior," then the youth replied,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Thy gift to us is dear,<br>
  Not for its worth, but that it shows<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thou deem'st our love sincere,<br>
  And in return broad lands I give&mdash;<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Broad lands thy Convent near;<br>
  Which shall to thee and thine produce<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A Thousand Marks a year!<br>
</p>

<p class="poem">
  "But this Condition I annex,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Or else the Grant's forsaken;<br>
  That whensoe'er a pair shall come,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And take the Oath we've taken,<br>
  They shall from thee and thine receive<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A goodly Flitch of Bacon.<br>
</p>

<p class="poem">
  "And thus from out a simple chance<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A usage good shall grow;<br>
  And our example of true love<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Be held up evermo:<br>
  While all who win the prize shall bless<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Custom of Dunmow."<br>

CHAPTER III
<br><br>
A Yeoman, a Husbandman and Thomas le Fuller
</h3>

<p>
Now all may have fallen out exactly as
Harrison Ainsworth tells us; but then, again,
as Uncle Remus says, "it moughtn't."
</p>

<p>
"Among the jocular tenures of England,"
writes Grose&mdash;he was the antiquary for whom
Burns wrote "Tam o' Shanter"&mdash;"none has
been more talked about than the Bacon of
Dunmow."  (A peppercorn rent, which still
appears in legal documents, is a kind of "jocular
tenure.")  In the theory of a jocular tenure
we have probably the true origin of the Flitch
custom.
</p>

<p>
Morant, the historian of Essex, seems to think
that this was the case.  He writes&mdash;
</p>

<p><br></p>

<p class="quote">
The Prior and Canons were obliged to deliver the Bacon
to them that took the Oath, by virtue (as many believe)
of a Founder or Benefactor's Deed or Will, by which they
held lands, rather than of their own singular frolic and
wantonness, or more probably it was imposed by the Crown,
either in Saxon or Norman times, and was a burthen upon
their estate.
</p>

<p class="quote">
It is explained that "after the Pilgrims, as the Claimants
were called, had taken the Oath, they were taken through
the Town in a Chair, on Men's Shoulders, with all the
Friars, Brethren, and Townsfolk, young and old, male
and female after them, with shouts and acclamations, and
the Bacon was borne before them on poles."
</p>

<p><br></p>

<p>
The Chartulary of Dunmow Priory (<i>Registrum
Cartarum Prioratus de Dunmawe</i>), a thickish
quarto, clearly written in old contracted Latin,
is still to be seen any day in the British Museum.
There are two entries in reference to the Flitch.
One is dated 1445, the other 1510.  The first is
on page 128 and the other on the opening page.
Both are among collections of memoranda apart
from the actual Chartulary, which itself
contains no reference to the Flitch.  (<i>See</i>
<a href="#appendix">Appendix</a>.)  Here are translations of the entries&mdash;
</p>

<p><br></p>

<p class="quote">
Memorandum: that one Richard Wright, of Badbourge,
near the City of Norwich, in the County of Norfolk,
Yeoman, came and required the Bacon of Dunmow on the 17th
day of April, in the 23rd year of the reign of King Henry VI,
and according to the form of the charter, was sworn before
John Cannon, Prior of this place and the Convent, and
many other neighbours, and there was delivered to him,
the said Richard, one Flitch of Bacon.
</p>

<p class="quote">
Memorandum: that in the year of our Lord, 1510,
Thomas le Fuller, of Coggeshall, in the County of Essex,
came to the Priory of Dunmow, and on the 8th September,
being Sunday, in the second year of King Henry VIII,
he was, according to the form of the Charter, sworn before
John Tylor, the Prior of the house and Convent, as also
before a multitude of neighbours, and there was delivered
unto him, the said Thomas, a Gammon of Bacon.
</p>

<p><br></p>

<p>
On a sheet pasted on the last page of a volume
of MSS. consisting of extracts from the Red
Book of the Exchequer ("Transcripta ex Libro
Rubeo in Scarrario"), the foregoing entries are
recorded in cramped English, and also a third,
which, as a matter of fact, is written first&mdash;
</p>

<p><br></p>

<p class="quote">
Memorandum: that one Stephen Samuel, of Little Easton,
in the County of Essex, Husbandman, came to the
Priory of Dunmow, on our Lady-day in Lent, in the Seventh
year of King Edward IV, and required a Gammon of Bacon,
and was sworn before Roger Bulcott, then Prior, and the
Convent of this place, as also before a multitude of other
neighbours, and there was delivered to him a Gammon
of Bacon.
</p>

<p><br></p>

<p>
It will be seen that in two cases it was a
Gammon not a Flitch of Bacon that was awarded.  (A
Flitch is a side, a Gammon a leg of Bacon.)
</p>

<p>
It is also of interest to notice that, in the cases
reported, the Bacon is given to a man, not to a
husband and wife.  An historian also speaks of
"the Pilgrim" and of "<i>his</i> Bacon being borne
before <i>him</i>."
</p>

<p>
The first recorded presentation of the Bacon is
dated, as will be observed, 1445.  But, in view
of the allusion in Chaucer a century before, it is
plain that the custom must have existed even
before his time.  The references to the custom
in other early authors would also seem to point
to the fact of it having been frequently observed.
There are, however, only three gifts of the Bacon
noted down in the documents of the Priory, now
in the care of the British Museum.

<h3>
CHAPTER IV
<br><br>
The Vanished Cloisters
</h3>

<p>
There is little now to be seen of the old
Priory spoken of by Leland.
</p>

<p>
Approached from the hamlet, the existing
Priory Church of Little Dunmow, with its roof
of staring blue slates, its factory chimney-like
bell tower and mean walling, attracts attention
only by its oddity.  But when one walks up the
farm land from which the south side of the
building may be viewed, one receives a different
impression.  In the architecture now seen there
are the
</p>

<p class="poem">
  lines where beauty lingers,<br>
</p>

<p class="noindent">
the lines which tell of a splendid structure.  The
remains of no common building stand in solitary
domination of these quiet corn fields.
</p>

<p>
One enters the church and is surprised, as
Mr. Hartley has written, by that
</p>

<p><br></p>

<p class="quote" style="text-indent: 0%">
indefinable feeling which ever strikes us on our entry into a
spacious and beautiful edifice.  That the building is a
fragment of what must have been a structure of extreme
beauty becomes evident.  Columns of such dimensions and
arches of such design were never intended for purpose
so slight as the support of the present roof; windows of
such size and elegance were made for shedding light upon
a much more spacious interior than we now find.
</p>

<p><br></p>

<p>
But when account is taken of all the stately
arches and columns, and the beautifully cut
ornament thereon, now embodied in the brick rubble
and plaster which we owe to Georgian and Early
Victorian dulness and parsimony, no more of the
old Priory survives for our refreshment than the
south aisle of the choir.  The stones of the
structure that were hewn and raised by some "Master
Henry" or "Master Hubert the Mason," the
timbers that some "Master John the Carpenter"
industriously wrought, even the marble and
alabaster which crowned the work have long been
torn away.  They are come upon now, in
fragments in the walls and floors and roofs of
cottages and barns which adjoin the church.

<hr>

<p><br></p>

<p>
Where the monastic building once extended
nothing remains but the out of sight foundations
which try the patience of the digger of land drains.
Labourers' patches of potatoes and greens range
over consecrated ground.  The fishponds of the
monks, to which they had recourse "on Fridays
when they fasted," grow grass or bear the burden
of a railway embankment.  Tradition and
propinquity, but these only, point to venerable
cottages and a farmhouse as marking the
position of the Priory's Manor house and Grange.
</p>

<p>
Of memorials of the Flitch ceremony two are
shown&mdash;the oaken seat, in which successful
applicants for the Bacon were chaired, and the stones
on which they knelt.
</p>

<p>
The chair is kept within the altar rails.  Two
persons could no doubt be squeezed into it.
There are holes in the chair through which the
bearers' poles went.
</p>

<p>
Whether the chair belonged originally to the
Prior and was actually used when he gave away
the Flitch, or was the property of one of the
Lords of the Manor, who, after the Dissolution
of the Monasteries, continued the custom, has
been disputed.  But there is evidence pointing
to the chair having been employed on the
occasion of the Manorial awards only.  Mr. F. Roe,
in his <i>Old Oak Furniture</i>, though he attributes
the chair to the thirteenth century, doubts very
much whether it can have been used from the
beginning for the ritual of the Flitch.  For this
reason&mdash;
</p>

<p><br></p>

<p class="quote">
The outer right-hand side of the chair is carved with
wheel-like decorations, but on the left-hand side the surface
of the wood is plain, and various mortices are visible,
which show that the seat is part of a larger structure, being,
in fact, the end unit of a series of stalls.  The truth is that
the chair used by merry-makers at the ceremony of the
Flitch, is actually a waif from the conventual establishment.
It is, one is bound to admit, a remarkable coincidence that
the chair and ceremony should have had their origin in the
same reign, but the fact that it is only part of some fitted
furniture, precludes the possibility of it having been
designed for the purpose for which it was used in later years.
</p>

<p><br></p>

<p>
In the accounts available of the awarding of
the Flitch after the closing of the religious houses
by Henry VIII we hear of "two great stones near
the Church door" on which the applicant for
the Bacon had to kneel.  Whether they are still
in existence is uncertain.
</p>

<p>
What are to-day pointed out as the stones on
which the Pilgrims knelt may possibly be the
bases of two of the many columns which local
vandals in want of building material have
demolished.  They are certainly not "sharp," as
some chroniclers describe the stones to have
been.  A pair of stones like those in the Church
are to be seen in Little Dunmow village.
</p>

<p>
In Hone's <i>Table Book</i>, published about the
time of the accession of Queen Victoria, it is said
that "the two great stones" were then in the
Church.  But whether the writer of this statement
had actually seen them for himself does not
appear.  It may perhaps be mentioned that, as the
first presentations of the Bacon were made seemingly
not to wedded pairs but to husbands only,
there could not be at this early stage of the history
of the Custom any need for "two" stones.  The
present stones are each only about half a foot
in diameter and the right distance apart for one
person to kneel on them.  They could hardly
be described as "great" stones.

<p><a id="chap05"></a></p>

<h3>
CHAPTER V
<br><br>
A Tale of Tyranny and War
</h3>

<p>
Below the pavement of the Priory Church
many dead sleep.  Four graves only are
marked by stones.  One resting-place, supposed
to be that of the Lady Juga, the foundress of the
Priory, is covered by a slab of grey marble
"coffin-fashioned, with a cross flory."  Over three other
tombs are mutilated alabaster effigies, once
"heedlessly thrown among heaps of bricks and
rubbish."
</p>

<p>
Begun, Dugdale and Morant say, in 1104,
the Priory was more than a century a-building.
Indeed, it was as late as 1501 that "five bells were
blessed in Dunmow steeple."  Only thirty-four
years were to pass before the Dissolution of the
Monasteries.  It is doubtful if the Priory was
even then finished.  In fact, in the expenses of
the Priory for 1534 are payments to two men
"for making of ix foote of the stepull."  (<i>See</i>
<a href="#appendix">Appendix</a>.)
</p>

<p>
We have seen how much now remains of the
scene whereon the Prior and his dozen Augustinian
monks prayed and ruled on revenues drawn
from holdings of land in four counties.
</p>

<p>
The Lady Juga was sister to one Ralph
Baynard who came over from Normandy with
William.  Among the twenty-five Essex lordships
which his sovereign gave him were those of
Great and Little Dunmow.  When the grandson
of this Baynard fell out with Henry I, it was not
long before that energetic monarch had a Fitzwalter
enjoying the advantages of the lordships.
</p>

<p>
Fitzwalters followed one another for ten generations.
The family is notable for the "Sir Reginald
Fitzwalter" of Harrison Ainsworth's ballad.
Tradition has long declared him to be old
Dugdale's Lord Robert who "re-edified the
decayed Priory of Dunmow."  He had the
generalship of that "Army of God and Holy Church"
which wrung Magna Charta from John in 1215,
and was "the first champion of English liberty."
</p>

<p><br></p>

<p class="quote">
This knight (says Newcourt) lived in all affluence of
Riches and Honour, 16y and ob. 1234, 19 Hen. III, and was
buried before the High Altar in this Priory Church near his
said daughter, the Fair Matilda.
</p>

<p><br></p>

<p>
The battered and chopped effigy of the
Fitzwalter now lying by the side of his wife in the
church is no longer said to be, however, but
rather the bearer of the name who died in
1432.
</p>

<p>
The remaining figure in the church may or
may not represent the "Fair Matilda."  A stern
archæologist has suggested, indeed, that it is
the effigy of the wife of the second of the
Fitzwalters.  But the touching and beautiful
expression of the alabaster face goes well with
what history and tradition tell us of the lovely
Matilda, and with the tale originally told in
the <i>Dunmow Chronicle</i>.
</p>

<p>
Legend has made her the "Maid Marian"
whom Friar Tuck united to Robin Hood, and the
story is set forth in a novel by the author of
the once-esteemed <i>Proverbial Philosophy</i>.
</p>

<p>
"Maid Marian" is, however, as Dr. Brewer
points out, the boy in the Morris dance, and is so
called from the morion which he wore on his
head.  ("A set of morrice dancers," says Temple,
"danced a maid marian.")
</p>

<p>
But the story of the pursuit of the beautiful
daughter of Fitzwalter by John has been thought
to be well founded.  Upon her father resisting
the King he was dispossessed of all his property.
Other barons took sides against the sovereign, and
Newcourt writes that Fitzwalter fled into France.
John, having spoiled the castles of those who
resisted him,
</p>

<p><br></p>

<p class="quote" style="text-indent: 0%">
sent a messenger to the fair Matilda now remaining here in
Dunmow about hie old suit in love, and because she would
not agree to his wicked motion, the messenger poison'd a
boil'd or poch'd egg against she was hungry and gave it to
her, whereof she died, and was buried here in the choir at
Dunmow, between two pillars in the S. side thereof.
</p>

<p><br></p>

<p>
Another story is that the King sent Matilda a
pair of poisoned gloves.  (<i>See</i> <a href="#appendix">Appendix</a>.)

is one of the Fitzwalters, and that the female figure lying

interment in 1627 recorded in the Register of the Church
is described as "next to the tomb of Matilda."

reconciliation being appointed between the two Kings, King John
passed over into France, and the two Armies were parted
by an arm of the sea.
</p>

<p class="quote">
Then an English knight went out and challenged any
to break a spear for his mistress's sake.  Robert Fitzwalter
came over, and, encountering with his great Lance,
overthrew both the Knight and the Horse, and so returned to
the King of France.
</p>

<p class="quote">
Then said King John, by God's Troth, he were a King
indeed who had such a Knight in his Retinue.  His friends,
hearing this, knelt before the King and said, Sir, he is your
Own Knight, and ready at your command, Robert Fitzwalter.
The next day he restored to him his Barony with all
appurtenances, and the two Kings were reconciled by the
interposition of Robert, and all the banished persons were
recalled, with leave to rebuild their castles.

"The death of Robin Hood with the lamentable
Tragedie of Chaste Matilda, his faire Maid
Marian poisoned at Dunmowe by King John,"

subject, and is reprinted by Hazlitt.  Michael
Drayton wrote poetical accounts of the story,
and in 1639 Robert Davenport produced a third
play, "King John and Matilda."

<h3>
CHAPTER VI
<br><br>
The Jury of Spinsters
</h3>

<p>
The last Prior of Dunmow was Geoffry
Shether.*  After the Dissolution of the
Monasteries, the duty of giving the Bacon seems
to have passed to the Lords of the Manor of Little
Dunmow.  They held their Courts&mdash;as they
have been held within living memory&mdash;at Priory
Place, formerly a farmhouse and now four
cottages.  In a parchment book belonging to a
former Lord of the Manor, the Rev. James
Hughes-Hallett, and now in the possession of
Mr. de Vins Wade of Great Dunmow, the present
Lord of the Manor, there is an account of the
Bacon ceremonies which was written in 1737.
</p>

<p><br></p>

<p class="footnote">
* See <a href="#appendix">Appendix</a>.
</p>

<p><br></p>

<p>
It is therein stated that the custom was first
instituted by the monks "in ye year 1111 and
continued to this day."  The "two hard stones"
are described as "yet to be seen in the doorway
of the Pryory," and it is explained that "the oath
was administered with such long process, and
such solemn singing over him, as doubtless must
make his Pilgrimage Painfull."
</p>

<p>
If it be true that the ceremony took place, as
described, "before the whole Towns," and that
the successful applicant for the Bacon was
"carried after through the Towns with all the
Fryers and Brethren and all the Townsfolk, young
and old, following them with shouts and
acclamations," it would appear that Great as well as
Little Dunmow had its share in the Flitch
custom.  The Manor of Little Dunmow extends
some distance into Great Dunmow.
</p>

<p>
In the Hughes-Hallett parchment (as also in
Lansdowne Roll, 25, British Museum), the
Manorial ceremony is chronicled&mdash;

solemnity to the ancient and accustomed place for the
Administration of the Oath (and receiving the Bacon
aforesaid), that is to say to the two great stones lying near
the church door within the said Manor
</p>

<p class="quote">
Whereupon the said John Reynolds and Ann kneeling
down on the said two stones the said Steward did administer
unto them the Oaths in these words or this effect following&mdash;
</p>

<p class="poem">
  You shall swear by Custom of Confession<br>
  That you ne'er made Nuptial Transgression;<br>
  Nor since you were married Man and Wife,<br>
  By Household Brawls or Contentious Strife,<br>
  Or otherwise in Bed or att board,<br>
  Offended each other in deed or word;<br>
  Or in a Twelve month time and a Day,<br>
  Repented not in Thought any way;<br>
  Or since the Church clerk said Amen,<br>
  Wish'd yourselves unmarried again,<br>
  But continued true, and in desire,<br>
  As when you join'd hand in holy Choire.<br>
</p>

<p><br></p>

<p class="quote">
And immediately thereupon ye said John Reynolds and
Ann, claiming the said Bacon, the Court pronounced
sentence for the same in these words or to the effect
following, viz.&mdash;
</p>

<p class="poem">
  Since to these Conditions without any fear,<br>
  Of your own accords you do truly swear;<br>
  A whole Gammon of Bacon you do receive,<br>
  And bear it away with love and good leave;<br>
  For this is the Custom at Dunmow well known.<br>
  Tho' the Pleasure be ours, the Bacon's your own.<br>
</p>

<p class="quote">
And accordingly a Gammon of Bacon with the usual
solemnity was delivered unto John Reynolds and Ann his
wife.
</p>

<p><br></p>

<p>
The interesting entry follows&mdash;
</p>

<p>
"N.B.&mdash;All the above mentioned Homage and
Mrs. Ann Reynolds are still living."

CHAPTER VII
<br><br>
&mdash;And Bachelors
</h3>

<p>
The Dunmow Bacon ceremony is discussed
in the <i>Spectator</i> of October 15, 1714, and
in the succeeding number, the writer concluding&mdash;
</p>

<p><br></p>

<p class="quote">
I hope your readers are satisfied of this truth, that as
love generally produces matrimony, so it often happens
that matrimony produces love.
</p>

<p><br></p>

<p>
Thirty-seven years later there is a record of the
giving of the Bacon by the Lord of the Manor,
the recipients being Thomas Shakeshaft, of the
parish of Weathersfield, Essex, weaver, and Ann
his wife.  They figure in the <i>Everyday Book</i>
illustration.  The "Hommage" on this occasion
consisted of Bachelors as well as Spinsters&mdash;
</p>

<p><br></p>

<p class="noindent">
  HOMMAGE.<br>
</p>

<p class="noindent">
  William Townsend, Gent.<br>
  Mary Cater, Spinster.<br>
  John Strutt, the younger, Gent.<br>
  Martha Wickford, Spinster<br>
  James Raymond, the younger, Gent.<br>
  Elizabeth Smith, Spinster.<br>
  Daniel Heckford, Gent.<br>
  Catherine Brett, Spinster.<br>
  Robert Mapletoft, Gent.<br>
  Eliza Hazlefoot, Spinster.<br>
  Richard Birch, Gent.<br>
  Sarah Mapletoft, Spinster.<br>
</p>

<p><br></p>

<p>
At this ceremony&mdash;it is reported in the <i>Gentleman's
Magazine</i> and the <i>London Magazine</i> of the
year&mdash;some five thousand persons were present.
The weaver Shakeshaft and his wife are said to
have made a good deal of money by selling slices
of their gammon.
</p>

<p>
Photographs of prints of scenes at the Shakeshaft
presentation&mdash;one from a painting by David
Ogbourne, a local artist*&mdash;are now reproduced.
</p>

<p><br></p>

<p class="footnote">
* <i>See Essex Review</i>, vol. viii.
</p>

<p><br></p>

<p>
It is as well the pictorial records were made, for
this ceremony of 1751 is regarded as "the last
legitimate instance" of the presentation of the
Bacon.
</p>

<p>
An old copperplate from Ogbourne's painting
has recently been acquired by Mr. Hastings
Worrin.
</p>

<p>
By the kindness of Mr. de Vins Wade we are
able to furnish photographs of the receipts given
by the Reynoldses and the Shakeshafts for their
Bacon.
</p>

<p>
The names of the witnesses who "doe certify
the proceedings" at the Shakeshaft ceremony
are&mdash;Susannah Smith, Susannah Calvert,
Thomas Pocklington, James Turner (? Turvin),
W. Wicksted, and Mark Gretton, Curate, who
is no doubt the clerical figure shown in the
Ogbourne picture.
</p>

<p>
Mr. Wade's father and grandfather were
stewards of the Manor, of which he is now the
Lord, from 1796 to 1837, and from 1837 to
1871 respectively.  Mr. de Vins Wade became
steward in 1891 and Lord of the Manor by
purchase in 1903.  The records in Mr. Wade's
possession go back to 1640.

<h3>
CHAPTER VIII
<br><br>
The Bacon Refused
</h3>

<p>
The register of the Priory Church of Little
Dunmow starts with the year 1555, but it
says nothing about the presentations of Bacon.
</p>

<p>
Following the Shakeshaft presentation of 1751
there is said (in Chambers's <i>Book of Days</i>) to have
been an award in 1763.  But Mr. Wade, on
examining the records of the Manor, finds that
no court was held in that year, "so," as he says,
"there could not have been a proper
presentation."  The story seems to be incorrect.  It
may be mentioned that the first Essex newspaper
was not started till 1764.  In 1772 a couple who
applied for the Flitch after due notice, and
appeared with "a great concourse of people,"
found, "to the great disappointment of the
happy couple and their numerous attendants, the
Priory gates fast nailed in pursuance of the
express orders of the Lord of the Manor."
</p>

<p>
Six years later, however, the Custom was sufficiently
alive for there to be produced at the
Haymarket Theatre a "ballad opera" called <i>The
Flitch of Bacon</i>.  It was the work of one Henry
Bates, the son of an Essex clergyman, but was
poor stuff.  A better verse than most ran&mdash;
</p>

<p class="poem">
  Since a year and a day<br>
  Have in love roll'd away,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And an oath of that love has been taken,<br>
  On the sharp pointed stones.<br>
  With your bare marrow bones,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;You have won our fam'd Priory bacon.<br>
</p>

<p><br></p>

<p>
The "poetry" written in connexion with the
Flitch ceremony is indeed more remarkable
for quantity than quality.  Four lines, produced
in 1803 and supposed to be a farmer's reply to an
inquiry as to how he came by the Flitch, run&mdash;
</p>

<p class="poem">
  I'll inform you, my friend, how it come.<br>
  You yourself will acknowledge the reason is clear,<br>
  As soon as I tell you that my pretty dear<br>
  Has been all her life&mdash;deaf and dumb!<br>
</p>

<p><br></p>

<p>
It is often said that when Queen Victoria had
been married a year and a day&mdash;ergo in 1841&mdash;the
then Lord of the Manor privately offered a
Flitch to Her Majesty, but that the compliment
was declined.  Mr. Wade, however, does not
remember to have heard anything of the
matter, and the story may have had its origin
in the publication of the burlesque of Stothard's
picture.  In the year 1851, just a century after
the Shakeshafts had had their Gammon, the
Bacon was refused by the Lord of the Manor
to a humbler personage, a yeoman farmer of the
name of Hurrell and his wife, living at Felsted, a
village lying in sight of Little Dunmow.
</p>

<p>
Thereupon, in order that the local custom
should not be extinguished, it was arranged to
give Mr. and Mrs. Hurrell their Bacon at a
"rural fête" at Easton Park.  The thing was
done with an imitation of the old ceremony and
with much enthusiasm, band-playing and eating
and drinking, in the presence of three thousand
people, "rich and poor, gentle and simple."

<h3>
CHAPTER IX
<br><br>
Enter the Novelist
</h3>

<p>
The novel, <i>The Flitch of Bacon: or, the
Custom of Dunmow, A Tale of English
Home</i>, was published by Harrison Ainsworth in
1854.  It was dedicated to Tauchnitz of the famous
Leipzig editions.
</p>

<p>
Much of the action takes place in a mythical
Dunmow Flitch Inn, which is described as having
once been the home of "Sir Walter Fitzwalter."  The
story turns largely on the desire of the four-times
married landlord of this hostelry to gain
the Bacon.
</p>

<p>
The house Ainsworth is thought to have had in
mind is Rose Farm, a building overlooking the
Church.  "Monkbury Place," the Lord of the
Manor's house, is imaginary, and Sir Gilbert de
Montfichet&mdash;Mountfichet is a local name,
however&mdash;has no place in history.
</p>

<p>
The novel is hard reading, but its publication
had the effect of attracting a good deal of notice
to that "Custom of Dunmow" described as "of
late years discontinued."  The inhabitants of
Great Dunmow&mdash;in the face of "injudicious but
fruitless opposition"&mdash;at length proceeded to
form a Committee, and Mr. Ainsworth subscribed
five guineas and the cost of two Flitches
of Bacon to a fund for a revival of the ceremony.
</p>

<p>
When the notices were issued quite a number
of applications were received.  A Kentish veterinary
surgeon and his wife were among the selected
couples, but the wife died before the ceremony
took place.  Eventually the opportunity of
presenting themselves at the "trial" was given to
the Chevalier and Madame de Chatelain of London,
known as translators from the French and
German, and to Mr. James Barlow, a Chipping
Ongar builder, and his wife.
</p>

<p>
The "jury of maidens and bachelors" sat in
the Town Hall, which was decorated with flowers,
and for the first time there were "Counsel for
the claimants" and "for the Bacon," also a Crier
who, "with mock ceremony," opened the Court.
</p>

<p>
The successful candidates were "carried in
procession to a fête near the town," where
Mr. Ainsworth awarded the Flitches.  The management
appears to have been placed in the hands of
the lessee of Drury Lane.
</p>

<p>
Two years afterwards Mr. Harrison Ainsworth
again presented Flitches.  The candidates were
Dr. and Mrs. J. N. Hawkins of Victoria Place,
Regent's Park, and Jeremiah Heard, a Staffordshire
policeman, and his wife.
</p>

<p>
For some reason or other the Bacon was
awarded to Mr. and Mrs. Heard only; "a silver
testimonial" was given to Mr. and Mrs. Hawkins.
In the course of the day, we are told, Mr. Ainsworth
animadverted on the action of the Lord of
the Manor in "neglecting to keep up his charter."

CHAPTER XI
<br><br>
The Scene at the Modern Ceremony
</h3>

<p>
Humorous account of a recent Flitch
festival, which appeared in the London
<i>Star</i>, may be reproduced in part, as an outsider's
impression of the modern ceremony&mdash;
</p>

<p><br></p>

<p class="quote">
The sun poured down on Dunmow meadows.  Most of
the population of the country round was gathered in holiday
dress, and a steam barrel organ, which neighed a series of
melodies without intermission, drove all the birds to the
adjoining counties and made things sonorously cheerful.
The rustics threw balls at cocoanuts, drank beer, ate cakes,
and disported themselves innocently through the early
hours awaiting the matrimonial inquisition.
</p>

<p class="quote">
The huge marquee tent, where the secrets of several
households were to be ruthlessly laid bare, was visited by
a number of chubby gentlemen who whispered mysteriously.
Finally, at three o'clock all was ready, and public
shillings flowed in a steady stream into the committee's
hat.  Soon the tent was crowded to suffocation.
</p>

<p class="quote">
There was a platform with a big chair for the judge, a
bench for the claimants and tables for the counsel.  There
were twelve seats for the jury on the left.  An assortment
of functionaries walked to and fro on the stage and
disappeared into side rooms through <i>portières</i> artistically
constructed of old corn bags blended in tasteful harmony.
Finally the <i>portières</i> swung back and the historical company
appeared.
</p>

<p class="quote">
There was a Judge in scarlet and ermine wearing a
full-bottomed wig which appeared to have been thoughtfully
improvised overnight from a woolly grey doormat.  There
were two Counsel in wigs and gowns, one for the claimants
and one against them.  There was an Usher in a gown and
fishing pole, which, it was explained to anxious enquirers,
was his rod of office.  This picturesque party sat down
with great gravity, and looked at each other with great
gravity until the jury came in.
</p>

<p class="quote">
The Jury created a sensation.  It consisted of six pairs
of strawberry and cream cheeks, six dimpled noses and six
new straw hats.  It wore other things also, including white
dresses and knots of pink ribbon to indicate its official
importance.  It also giggled and then looked serious, but it did
not all giggle at once or look serious at once.
</p>

<p class="quote">
After the young misses came six lads with knots of ribbon
and feet which the owners seemed to want to get out of the
way.  One juryman in his despair had the courage to begin
a conversation with the young jurywoman in front of him.
</p>

<p class="quote">
It is one of the rules of the Flitch that the married couples
shall be judged by a Jury whose matrimonial knowledge is
purely theoretical.
</p>

<p class="quote">
The first couple were a parson and his wife, both a little
portly.  They were a charming couple however, and had
the documents to prove it.  The second pair was a doctor
and his wife and both wore eye-glasses.  They were slender.
The wife smiled pleasantly and the husband looked shrewd
and good-natured.  The lady belonging to the third couple
seemed starched and stiff and her husband had rather a
crisp expression.  The first name of the male claimant
in this case was William Willie.  Smaller absurdities than
this have been the subject of a domestic scene, but the life
of Mr. and Mrs. William Willie was understood to be
beautiful.  Mrs. William Willie was a laundress, and
William Willie occasionally helped her.
</p>

<p class="quote">
The history of each couple was given.  They were all
of middle age and had all been married within a few years.
Mr. William Willie, it was said, fell in love with Mrs. William
Willie at Hounslow, and, though called to foreign parts,
returned to find her faithful.
</p>

<p class="quote">
The attorney for the claimants was an eloquent man.
He spoke of Fitzwalter and other things and then he said
that he was confident that his clients would safely pass the
ordeal and told the jury so repeatedly, the jury giggling
each time.
</p>

<p class="quote">
When the first couple stood up it was certainly very
funny.  The audience laughed loud and long.  There is
nothing very much funnier than a sedate and elderly couple
being gravely questioned in the presence of hundreds of
people concerning the details of their daily life.
Mr. William Willie said his wife was the best woman in England,
and she always sweetly bade him goodbye when he went and
greeted him with a loving smile when he came.  The
searching questions were so absurd and were answered in
such a straightforward way that the Counsel for the claimants
lost control of himself and laughed till the tears rolled
down his cheeks, the audience doing likewise.
</p>

<p class="quote">
Mrs. William Willie was equally straightforward but a
little uncomfortable.  She explained that her husband
wiped his feet in muddy weather, did not smoke too much
and never indulged in spirituous liquors.
</p>

<p class="quote">
Finally the Counsel, with a triumphant glance at the
Jury, turned this pair over to the opposing Counsel.
</p>

<p class="quote">
Then came some impromptu repartee between Counsel,
which was entirely successful.  Then searching questions
by the Counsel for the Bacon and more laughter.  Mr. and
Mrs. William Willie had testimonials from friends who had
visited them to say that a cross word was unknown in their
home.  Counsel said that was all very well, but no one
quarrelled before company.  He wanted to know whether
affairs were equally amicable in private.  With great
ingenuity he went over all the various ways in which husbands
manage to ruffle the feathers of their spouses, but finally
based his address to the Jury on the general valuelessness of
testimonials and the all-round improbability of the whole
story.
</p>

<p class="quote">
Then came another hot argument for the claimants, and
the Judge summed up with great impartiality.  After this
the case went to the Jury.
</p>

<p class="quote">
It was awkward at first, but soon it got to whispering
quite busily.  Each jurywoman leaned back and was talked
to by the juryman behind her, six pink ears being in such
close proximity to six downy upper lips that nobody was in
the least surprised when it was announced that the Jury
wished to retire.  It retired and it was gone many minutes.
It was even feared that it had eloped, and the usher with
the fishing pole was sent after it, and brought it back.  It
settled down with more giggles and the verdict was
announced: For the claimants.  And there was a storm of
applause.

It is hardly necessary to add the comment of
an historian of Essex on the attempt "to raise the
ghost of the Custom": "The ceremony was
only a theatrical parade of dry bones; the ancient
spirit of the thing was not there&mdash;so
impossible is it for society to go backward or to clothe
with flesh the skeleton of an obsolete habit or
dead custom, which modern feeling and refinement
have long entombed."
</p>

<p>
Three years ago an imitation of the Dunmow
celebration was attempted at Walthamstow.
</p>

<p>
In 1909 the farmers round about Dunmow, by
co-operating to form a Dunmow Flitch Bacon
Factory, carried forward the Bacon tradition
on new lines.
</p>

<p>
This local record&mdash;by a Vegetarian! for
<i>tempora mutantur</i>, and with the changed times
which have overthrown the Flitch, <i>nos mutamur in
illis</i>&mdash;should not close perhaps without the
following extract from a rhyme in <i>Punch</i>.  If a
little better than some other poetical effusions
on the subject of the Flitch, it certainly ignores
the basic principle of the Flitch foundation,
that it takes two to make a quarrel!&mdash;

CHAPTER XII
<br><br>
Another Flitch Custom
</h3>

<p>
A bacon custom, not unlike that of Dunmow,
existed at Wichnor, a little place
near Lichfield.  It originated in a jocular tenure
by which Sir Philip de Somerville held the Manor
from Edward III.  In memory of that tenure
a wooden Flitch of Bacon is displayed to this
day above the great fireplace in Wichnor Hall.
The oath was to the following effect&mdash;
</p>

<p><br></p>

<p class="quote">
Hear ye, Sir Philip de Somervile, lord of Whichenoure,
maintainer and giver of this Bacon, that I, A, syth I wedded
B, my wyfe, and syth I had her in my kepying and at
wylle, by a Yere and a Daye after our Marryage, I
would not have changed for none other, farer ne fowler,
richer ne pourer, ne for none other descended of gretter
lynage, sleeping ne waking, at noo time, and if the said B
were sole and I sole, I would take her to be my wyfe before all
other wymen of the worlde, of what condytion soevere they
be, good or evyle, as helpe me God, and Seyntys, and this
flesh and all fleshes.
</p>

<p><br></p>

<p>
The foregoing words are inscribed below the
Flitch.  There is a reference to them, in one of
Horace Walpole's Letters.
</p>

<p>
To an applicant who was a "villeyn" corn and
a cheese were given in addition to the Flitch.
A horse was also provided to take him beyond
the limits of the Manor, the free tenants of
which were to accompany him with "trompets,
tabourets, and other manoir of mynstralcie."
</p>

<p>
Pennant, who went to "Whichenoure House"
in 1780, says the local Flitch had "remained
untouched from the first century of its institution
to the present."  He also avers that "the late
and present worthy owners of the Manor were
deterred from entering into the holy state from
the dread of not obtaining their own Bacon!"  The
present owner of Wichnor, or Wychnor Park,
is Mr. T. B. Levett.  The Lord of the Manor is
Lord Lichfield.  In the Lichfield Road there is
a "Flitch of Bacon" inn as there is in Little
Dunmow.

CHAPTER XIII
<br><br>
The Bacon Over Sea
</h3>

<p>
A few years ago Mr. Hastings Worrin, J.P.,
a churchwarden of the Priory Church of
Little Dunmow, and a well-known collector of
memorials of the Bacon ceremonies and of the
old Priory, to whom the writer of this record is
greatly indebted, received a letter addressed to
"The Prior of Dunmow."  It was from a New
York lawyer and his wife, also a member of the
legal profession, who had had a little Flitch
celebration on their own account, and seemed to
think (as the <i>Times</i> of August 21, 1803, actually
did) that the old Priory still existed&mdash;
</p>

<p><br></p>

<p class="quote">
Whereas, (runs a little fly sheet which they issued to their
friends) Girdwood Mulliner and Gabrielle his wife, in reverence
for the old tradition, its quaint basic thought so sweetly
resting in the sanctity of the marriage relation, knowing in
their hearts that they have earned the Flitch of Bacon by
the sure right of their living, although far from the Priory
and the pointed stones, do here and now kneel and lay claim
to it&mdash;
</p>

<p class="quote">
I, Leslie Allen Wright, the chief attendant to the Bridegroom
upon his day of wedding, praying a grace of pardon
for usurping the Prior's rightful duty, yet feeling the fine
prompting spirit of the ancient custom, do now bestow upon
these two worthy persons, Walter Girdwood Mulliner and
Gabrielle his wife, a Flitch of Bacon.
</p>

<p class="quote">
May they in all the added years of their life grow in
Ripeness and in Spirit.  Amen.
</p>

<p><br></p>

<p>
A Bacon custom in Brittany has been referred
to.  Mention may also be made of a German
story, "The Man and the Flitch of Bacon";
also of the Flitch which hung in the old Red
Tower of Vienna with doggerel below it which
Dr. Bell has thus translated&mdash;
</p>

<p class="poem">
  Is there to be found a married man<br>
  That in verity declare can,<br>
  That his marriage him doth not rue,<br>
  That he has no fear of his wife for a shrew,<br>
  He may this Bacon for himself down hew?<br>
</p>

<p><br></p>

<p>
The tale goes that a would-be possessor of the
Red Tower Bacon asked, when a ladder had been
brought for his assistance, that some one should
cut down the Flitch for him, as if he got a grease-spot
on his best clothes his wife would scold him!
Needless to say, this applicant was not allowed
to have the Bacon.
</p>

<p>
Dr. Bell traces to the earliest times the origin
of all customs of hanging up Bacon.  Does not
Dionysius Halicarnassus mention the presence of
a fine Flitch in the chief temple at Alba Longa?
Jewellers still sell as charms little pigs of gold,
silver and bog oak, and in time past the side of
what had once been a sow was no doubt displayed
as an emblem of fertility.

<a id="appendix"></a>
APPENDIX
<br><br>
The Last Prior of Dunmow
</h3>

<p>
In the Manuscript Department of the British Museum
one may turn over in Latin and in an old English
transcript, the household accounts kept by Geoffrey
Shether, the last Prior of Dunmow.  During the
last four years of the Priory's existence, 1531-5, that
is up to the time of the dissolution of the minor
monasteries, the Prior entered up his accounts every
Sunday in a long narrow book such as one sees on
bakers' counters.
</p>

<p>
The entries at the very end of the book are in
regard to the payment to one "Purcas"&mdash;still a
Little Dunmow name&mdash;"for iiij days' werke, xxd,"
and to two "labryng" men for their "werke."  Earlier
in the book a payment "to my stuarde for
kepying of my Curte at Dunmowe" is chronicled.
A large proportion of the expenses are in respect of
farm work or stock.  There is an entry more than
once for "stoor bolox."  On several occasions
expenditure was incurred for the ringing of pigs and the
destruction of rats.  There are also various sums for
work on the steeple.
</p>

<p>
The fishponds of our illustration do not appear to
have yielded all the fish needed by the Priory, for
there are two entries for "fyscche" bought.  If there
is no mention of Bacon, there are "rewardes for
venison," and if no allusion occurs to the Flitch
ceremony, it was not, apparently, because the Prior
would have been above being interested in such
a mundane thing, for twice or thrice he puts down
"my costs at the feyr," and he gave a "reward to
the Lord of Mysrule of Dunmow."  Moreover, is
there not an entry, "For sugar candy I bowte"?

The Fair Matilda
</p>

<p>
The story of the poisoning of the Fair Matilda is in
the Cotton MS., Cleopatra, C. iii., folio 291 (British
Museum), a sixteenth or early seventeenth century
copy of or extract from the <i>Dunmow Chronicle</i>.  The
original of the <i>Chronicle</i> has not been traced.  Tanner
in his <i>Notitia Monastica</i> does not mention it, but
only the Cotton MS. and the Harley MS. referred to
in the Introduction to this booklet.  The story is
entered under the year 1211, in which "mota est
discordia inter Regem Johannem et Barones suos
occasione Matildis," etc.  The Chartulary of Dunmow
Priory (page 20), a register of charters, deeds, etc.,
is quite a different thing from the <i>Chronicle</i>, and
does not contain the story.  The Chartulary is in
handwriting of the thirteenth century.  The rubric
at the beginning gives the date of its compilation as
1275.  A few documents have been copied into it at
later times.
